<p>Teaching R to 5th graders-Middle Schoolers during the weekend has been both enlightening and humbling.<br />
Enlightening because kids understand data with context far better than adults; perhaps because they are not encumbered by the <code>Big Data</code> noise and always prefer visualization over text. I’ve learned to work within the limits of their attention span (so lots of breaks) and interest, cultivating a continuous learning environment versus a competitive one, a “We” versus an “I” approach, and “humbleness” in place “arrogance”.</p>
<p>I, and the 5th graders/Middle Schoolers, would like to thank <a href="%22https://www.rstudio.com/%22">RStudio</a> (Garrett Grolemund, J.J. Allaire, Hadley Wickham, Roger Oberg) and <a href="%22https://www.datacamp.com/home%22">Datacamp</a> (Nick Carchedi, Jonathan Cornelissen) for their kindness and all the help, encouragement and support in Tara’s and Ben’s journey to learning R. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Here are a few of their projects:</p>
