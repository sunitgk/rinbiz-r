<p>Teaching R to 5th graders-Middle Schoolers during the weekend has been both enlightening and humbling.<br />
Enlightening because kids understand data with context far better than adults; perhaps because they are not encumbered by the <code>Big Data</code> noise and always prefer visualization over text. I’ve learned to work within the limits of their attention span (so lots of breaks) and interest, cultivating a continuous learning environment versus a competitive one, a “We” versus an “I” approach, and “humbleness” in place “arrogance”.</p>
<p>I, and the 5th graders/Middle Schoolers, would like to thank <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> (<strong>Garrett Grolemund, J.J. Allaire, Hadley Wickham, Roger Oberg</strong>) and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/home">Datacamp</a> (<strong>Nick Carchedi, Jonathan Cornelissen</strong>) for their kindness and all the help, encouragement and support in Tara’s and Ben’s journey to learning R. Thank you so much.</p>
