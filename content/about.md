I'm a Business/Data Scientist with a background in Computer Science and Computational Finance.  I enjoy wrangling insights from the customer asset-base, and enable decision-making that maximizes the return on [**Data P&L**](http://www.cybaea.net/Journal/2017/08/04/Towards-Data-Value-Management/). R is my favorite tool for wrangling, analyzing and presenting the end-analysis product as interactive apps. This blog therefore is about using R in solving Business problems, Cotons, Teaching 5th-Middle Schoolers, and the best of Baristas.
